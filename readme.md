# TinyApp Project 

Tiny app is a link shortner, a user can input a long, hard to type link, and the user is given a simple 6 character link (for example: website.com/123456) that they can share. Tiny app is very focused on backend, the backend is built with node and express, including ejs and cookies. 

## What Tiny app looks like

![login page]()
![register page]()
